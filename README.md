# 🧠 AI-Based Workforce Productivity & Burnout Analyzer

An AI-powered web application built with **Flask** that helps analyze an employee's productivity and burnout risk level based on working hours, tasks completed, breaks taken, and satisfaction level.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Predict employee burnout risk using a trained ML model (`burnout_model.pkl`)
- Store and view prediction history in an SQLite database
- Modern, responsive UI with gold-gray theme
- Secure and scalable structure
- View results in **Low, Medium, and High Burnout Risk**
- Easy to deploy (PythonAnywhere, Render, or Heroku)
